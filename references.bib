abstract = {Cortical neurons extracted from the developing rat central nervous system and put in culture, show, after a few days, spontaneous activity with a typical electrophysiological pattern ranging from stochastic spiking to synchronized bursting. Using microelectrode arrays (MEA), on which dissociated cultures can be grown for long-term measurements, we recorded the electrophysiological activity of cortical networks during development, in order to monitor their responses at different stages of the maturation process. Employing algorithms for detection and analysis of bursts in single-channel spike trains and of synchronized network bursts in multi-channel spike trains, significant changes have been revealed in the firing dynamics at different stages of the developmental process. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Wagenaar2006,
abstract = {Background: We have collected a comprehensive set of multi-unit data on dissociated cortical cultures. Previous studies of the development of the electrical activity of dissociated cultures of cortical neurons each focused on limited aspects of its dynamics, and were often based on small numbers of observed cultures. We followed 58 cultures of different densities - 3000 to 50,000 neurons on areas of 30 to 75 mm2 - growing on multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) during the first five weeks of their development. Results: Plating density had a profound effect on development. While the aggregate spike detection rate scaled linearly with density, as expected from the number of cells in proximity to electrodes, dense cultures started to exhibit bursting behavior earlier in development than sparser cultures. Analysis of responses to electrical stimulation suggests that axonal outgrowth likewise occurred faster in dense cultures. After two weeks, the network activity was dominated by population bursts in most cultures. In contrast to previous reports, development continued with changing burst patterns throughout the observation period. Burst patterns were extremely varied, with inter-burst intervals between 1 and 300 s, different amounts of temporal clustering of bursts, and different firing rate profiles during bursts. During certain stages of development bursts were organized into tight clusters with highly conserved internal structure. Conclusion: Dissociated cultures of cortical cells exhibited a much richer repertoire of activity patterns than previously reported. Except for the very sparsest cultures, all cultures exhibited globally synchronized bursts, but bursting patterns changed over the course of development, and varied considerably between preparations. This emphasizes the importance of using multiple preparations - not just multiple cultures from one preparation - in any study involving neuronal cultures. {\textcopyright} 2006 Wagenaar et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Accurate detection and quantification of spike transmission between neurons is essential for determining neural network mechanisms that govern cognitive functions. Using point process and conductance-based simulations, we found that existing methods for determining neuronal connectivity from spike times are highly affected by burst spiking activity, resulting in over- or underestimation of spike transmission. To improve performance, we developed a mathematical framework for decomposing the cross-correlation between two spike trains. We then devised a deconvolution-based algorithm for removing effects of second-order spike train statistics. Deconvolution removed the effect of burst spiking, improving the estimation of neuronal connectivity yielded by state-of-the-art methods. Application of deconvolution to neuronal data recorded from hippocampal region CA1 of freely-moving mice produced higher estimates of spike transmission, in particular when spike trains exhibited bursts. Deconvolution facilitates the precise construction of complex connectivity maps, opening the door to enhanced understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying brain function.},

@article{English2017,
abstract = {Excitatory control of inhibitory neurons is poorly understood due to the difficulty of studying synaptic connectivity in vivo. We inferred such connectivity through analysis of spike timing and validated this inference using juxtacellular and optogenetic control of presynaptic spikes in behaving mice. We observed that neighboring CA1 neurons had stronger connections and that superficial pyramidal cells projected more to deep interneurons. Connection probability and strength were skewed, with a minority of highly connected hubs. Divergent presynaptic connections led to synchrony between interneurons. Synchrony of convergent presynaptic inputs boosted postsynaptic drive. Presynaptic firing frequency was read out by postsynaptic neurons through short-term depression and facilitation, with individual pyramidal cells and interneurons displaying a diversity of spike transmission filters. Additionally, spike transmission was strongly modulated by prior spike timing of the postsynaptic cell. These results bridge anatomical structure with physiological function. English, McKenzie, et al. identify, validate, and quantify monosynaptic connections between pyramidal cells and interneurons, using the spike timing of pre- and postsynaptic neurons in vivo. Their large-scale method uncovers a backbone of connectivity rules in the hippocampus CA1 circuit.},

@article{Lee2020,
abstract = {Spike sorting is a critical first step in extracting neural signals from large-scale multi-electrode array (MEA) data. This manuscript presents several new techniques that make MEA spike sorting more robust and accurate. Our pipeline is based on an efficient multi-stage “triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit” approach that initially extracts only clean, high-quality waveforms from the electrophysiological time series by temporarily skipping noisy or “collided” events (representing two neurons firing synchronously). This is accomplished by developing a neural network detection and denoising method followed by efficient outlier triaging. The denoised spike waveforms are then used to infer the set of spike templates through nonparametric Bayesian clustering. We use a divide-and-conquer strategy to parallelize this clustering step. Finally, we recover collided waveforms with matching-pursuit deconvolution techniques, and perform further split-and-merge steps to estimate additional templates from the pool of recovered waveforms. We apply the new pipeline to data recorded in the primate retina, where high firing rates and highly-overlapping axonal units provide a challenging testbed for the deconvolution approach; in addition, the well-defined mosaic structure of receptive fields in this preparation provides a useful quality check on any spike sorting pipeline. We show that our pipeline improves on the state-of-the-art in spike sorting (and outperforms manual sorting) on both real and semi-simulated MEA data with > 500 electrodes; open source code can be found at <https://github.com/paninski-lab/yass>.},

@article{Laboy-Juarez2019,
abstract = {Spike sorting is the process of detecting and clustering action potential waveforms of putative single neurons from extracellular voltage recordings. Typically, spike detection uses a fixed voltage threshold and shadow period, but this approach often misses spikes during high firing rate epochs or noisy conditions. We developed a simple, data-driven spike detection method using a scaled form of template matching, based on the sliding cosine similarity between the extracellular voltage signal and mean spike waveforms of candidate single units. Performance was tested in whisker somatosensory cortex (S1) of anesthetized mice in vivo. The method consistently detected whisker-evoked spikes that were missed by the standard fixed threshold. Detection was improved most for spikes evoked by strong stimuli (40–70% increase), improved less for weaker stimuli, and unchanged for spontaneous spiking. This represents improved detection during spatiotemporally dense spiking, and yielded sharper sensory tuning estimates. We also benchmarked performance using computationally generated voltage data. Template matching detected $\sim$85–90% of spikes compared to $\sim$70% for the standard fixed threshold method, and was more tolerant to high firing rates and simulated recording noise. Thus, a simple template matching approach substantially improves detection of single-unit spiking for cortical physiology.},
